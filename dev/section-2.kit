                    <p>“Flying Fish” for the constellation 
                        in the Southern Hemisphere that 
                        represents “exploration and adventure.” 
                        By allowing drinkers to engage with 
                        him directly, he soon garnered attention 
                        and accolades that led to the funding 
                        that made Gene’s dream a reality.

                    <p>We may not end up as the greatest success 
                        story on earth, but at least we had the 
                        balls to try. Sometimes, for better or 
                        worse, your dreams get the best of you. 
                        Just remember, it's a big world out 
                        there and cubicles don't have doors, so 
                        you can walk out anytime.
